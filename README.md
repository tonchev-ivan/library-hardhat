# Book Library Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test # gas reporting is enabled by default; might need to get coinmarketcap token
npx hardhat coverage # coverage report
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
